	 * The method does not intend to compute a positive score since it is expected to be used to reject incompatible ones and will return 0 if provided with an empty set of equivalence 
	 * classes (which means that computation of scores returned -1 and hence did not populate equivalence classes). 
	 * 
	 * In a similar way to ordinary Sicco score computation, there are three modes,
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Only look at the current pair to merge and the states that got merged into it.</li>
	 * <li>Look at mergers of any state into a red state (if there are multiple red states being merged together, this will do a union of their outgoing transitions).</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * Unlike the score computation that relies on mergers between a branch of a tree and a graph, this scoring routine cannot tell whether any node comes from a tree or from the main graph (except where they are labelled red or blue).
	 * This is why it cannot do an equivalent of 'recursive' computation where one follows a branch and checks states against those in the main graph. On the positive side, it can be used
	 * for arbitrary mergers in a graph, something that typical Sicco score computation cannot handle.
	 * 
	 * There is no provision for 'blue' states because during score computation, it is not known which states are going to be blue or will immediately become red.
	 * 
	 * @param pair a pair of states to be merged, only used for where checking is limited to the first pair. In reality it matches all red states that got merged into the one provided with all blue ones that got merged with those red ones.
	 * @param mergedVertices describes vertices that are to form clusters of new states. This does not have to be a total map: clusters of states not in the collection are ignored since they are assumed to be singletons.
	 * @param howToScore the scoring method to use.
