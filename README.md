# statechum
Statechum project, originally on sourceforge

Statechum is the tool that can be used for the inference of models and their comparison as well as for test generation. 
The inference process can use both passive and active. 
For the passive one, Blue Fringe can be used; active learner uses QSM.

A relatively brief manual can be found in resources/introduction/index.html
